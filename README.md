Voice browsers allow people to access the Web using speech synthesis, pre-recorded audio, and speech recognition. This can be supplemented by keypads and small displays. Voice may also be offered as an adjunct to conventional desktop browsers with high resolution graphical displays, providing an accessible alternative to using the keyboard or screen, for instance in automobiles where hands/eyes free operation is essential. Voice interaction can escape the physical limitations on keypads and displays as mobile devices become ever smaller. The browser will have an integrated text extraction engine that inspects the content of the page to construct a structured representation. The internal nodes of the structure represent various levels of abstraction of the content. This helps in easy and flexible navigation of the page so as to rapidly home into objects of interest. Finally, the browser is integrated to an automatic Text-To-Speech transliteration engine that outputs the selected text in the form of speech.
